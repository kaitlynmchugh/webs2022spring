# Proposal 

For my web project, I'd like to create a portfolio of the variety of projects I've worked on throughout my college career, whether they are strictly for school or as a hobby/just for fun. This will combine all of my research/chemistry related interests with my interest in the arts, such as painting, filmmaking, and digital media, including the projects we've created in this class. I am planning on a few different pages currently: a Home page to welcome viewers to the site, an About page to give the viewers more information about me, and a Research page to showcase all the posters, presentations, publications, and talks I've been a part of. I'm debating including one big "Art" page to include painting, filmmaking, and digital media, or to separate that into "Filmmaking," which would only contain short films, and "Art," which would contain the digital art and painting I've done. I think the sketch I'm leaning toward the most is the bottom left, which also shows what the separate pages woould look like, with research as an example.
