    <h2>Welcome to my personal portfolio</h2>

    <div class='education'>
    <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>I'm currently a senior at the University of Pittsburgh studying Chemistry on the Bioscience track. Outside of class, I can be found tutoring general chemistry students in the Study Lab, or in Chevron Science Center synthesizing nanoparticles.</p>

    <div class='research'>
    <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>I've always been interested in learning new things and understanding how exactly a process works, which is definitely what led me to pursue chemistry research. Everyday involves either performing a new experiment or learning something new from an old experiment! I'm particularly interested in the fields of nanotechnology and environmental chemistry. In the past, at the University of Pennsylvania, I worked with the <a href="https://osujilab.seas.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">Osuji group</a> studying the synthesis and characterization of microfibers. At the University of Pittsburgh, I'm currently working with the <a href="https://jem210.weebly.com/" target="=_blank">Millstone group</a> studying nanomaterials, with a focus on photoreactor-synthesized nanoparticles and the effect reducing agent on particle structure. After graduation, I will pursuing a career in research, working as an R&D Chemist for The Chemours Company.</p>

    <h3>Art and Media</h3>
      <p>I'm able to explore my more creative side by producing (and consuming) art and media. I've always had an interest in the horror genre, with slashers holding a special place in my heart, so I've found that one of my favorite things to do when bored with friends is to make a short horror film. I've also become interested in writing horror screenplays and short stories. Another hobby I enjoy is painting, particularly on denim. In my digital media class, I was able to combine these interests to create various media projects, whether they were audio, visual, or web-based.</p>
