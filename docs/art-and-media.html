    <h2>Last Night at Slashfest</h2>
      <p>"Last Night at Slashfest" is an audio narrative I created as a part of my digital media class in 2022. The narrative is set at Slashfest, where you'll find everything the horror-lovers and thrill-seekers in your life could ever need. When you step into the park, you will be immersed in what can only be described as a Halloween-wonderland. As you wander through the variety of houses set up this season, featuring <i>Asylum of Abandon</i>, <i>Nightmare in the Swamp</i>, and the newly improved and relocated <i>Funhouse of Terror</i>, watch out for any escaped inmates, rogue clowns, and chainsaw-wielding maniacs that may be lurking anywhere in the park. If you'd rather chase thrills than ghosts, check out our new steel coaster <i>Demon Slayer</i>, or the family favorite <i>Ghost Gliders</i>. Don't forget to try some of our famous freshly popped kettle-corn, fried funnel cake, and our locally sourced hot apple cider. Open now until October 31st! </p>
      <p>When Erin and Zak arrive at Slashfest, they're seeking something much more exciting than jump scares, coasters, and clown costumes. After hearing rumors of the old funhouse being haunted, they decide to take a paranormal investigation into their own hands. Will they emerge with compelling evidence of the paranormal, or will they join the cast of characters tasked with terrifying the guests of Slashfest, forever?</p>

    <h2>Atoms, Molcules, and Materials Flyer</h2>
      <p>This flyer is a visual argument I created as a part of digital media class in 2022. This visual argument aims to advertise a very underrated chemistry class at the University of Pittsburgh, called "Atoms, Molecules, and Materials." In this class, students learn important theories and lab techniques related to nanomaterials. Students will also discover that nanomaterials are a much bigger part of our everyday life than you can imagine! Scan the QR code to get more information on enrollment today. In the flyer, I have represented just a few of the aspects of nanomaterials covered in the course. I actually used three of my own images in the project: two of interesting topics in textbooks that we discussed in class, and one of my colleague Riti Sen hard at work synthesizing nanoparticles in the lab. The last image represents an application of nanomaterials. They are frequent components of electronics in the form of semiconductors.

      <h2>Denim Jacket Collection </h2>
        <p> I first started painting denim jackets in March 2020. As school went completely online, I was able to pick up a new hobby. All of these jackets were painted with acryllic paint mixed with a fabric medium. </p>
        <p><strong>Freddy vs. Jason</strong>: This was the first denim jacket I decided to paint, which led to me really enjoying the process and the result, so much that I ended up painting two more!</p>
        <p><strong>Dr. Manhattan</strong>: This was the second jacket I painted. The image is a page out of the graphic novel "Watchmen" published in 1986. </p>
        <p><strong>The Witcher</strong>: This was the most recent denim jacket I painted. On the back, I painted the white wolf emblem, that resembles the necklace Geralt wears in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. I also painted the symbol for each sign, Aard, Igni, Yrden, Quen, and Axii on the sleeve. I tried switching from blue to black denim for this project, and was pleasantly surprised at how well the paint held up against the darker color, although it did require a few more coats!</p>

        <h2>Ghost Adventures: The Cove</h2>
          <p>This short film is a spoof on the show "Ghost Adventures," hosted by Zak Bagans. My cohost and I, Gabby, "investigated" the haunted hotel we were staying at in Windham, New York. This spoof covers all the bases of a typical Ghost Adventures episode, including the historical background on the location, the crew taking on a random activity before the investigation, and, of course, the compelling evidence of the paranormal in The Cove.</p>

        <h2>Samulet</h2>
          <p>This film observes the events that took place on what should've been a typical jog in the woods. An ambitious runner decides to take their usual route on a very, very cold day in Pittsburgh. The runner is instead tormented by something that haunts these woods, and is rumoured to possess a very foreboding necklace. Throughout the film, the main character encounters many ominous signs, all indicating that maybe she should've stayed out of these woods today.</p>

        <h2>Castañuelas</h2>
          <p>This film was inspired by a set of castañuelas, or clackers, that were a souvenir from Spain. Clackers are typically used as a percussion instrument in Spanish music. However, alone, these clackers seemed to make a relatively eerie sound. In this film, the main character can't seem to get this sound out of her head. She should be able to ignore it, but she is drawn to the sound and decides to investigate the source of the menacing click...</p>
