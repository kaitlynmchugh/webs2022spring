    <h2>Synthesis, Characterization, and Flow Behavior of Biomaterial-based Microfibers</h2>
    <h3> University of Pennsylvania, Center for Engineering Mechanobiology (CEMB)</h3>
    <p>In the summer of 2021, I was selected to be a part of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program with the Center for Engineering Mechanobiology (CEMB) at the University of Pennsylvania. While working on this project, I synthesized microfibers from biodegradable natural polymers and investigated their potential as a replacement for synthetic polymers. I was able to learn and utilize many characterization methods, such as optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and rheology. At the end of the program, I submitted an abstract on my results to the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) and was selected to present a poster at the 2021 Annual Meeting.</p>

      <h2>The Fluorescence of Effervescence: Analysis of Fluorophore and Quencher Concentration on Fluorescence</h2>
      <h3>University of Pittsburgh, Analytical Chemistry Laboratory</h3>
        <p>As the final project for the analytical laboratory course, each student was tasked with creating and presenting a poster on one of the experiments performed. I presented on the experiment in which we measured the fluorescence intenisty with changing concentration of fluorphore and quencher. </p>
